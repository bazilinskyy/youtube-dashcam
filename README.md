## Getting Started
Tested with Python 3.9.19. To setup the environment run these two commands in a parent folder of the downloaded repository (replace `/` with `\` and possibly add `--user` if on Windows:

**Step 1:**

Clone the repository
```command line
git clone https://github.com/bazilinskyy/youtube-dashcam
```

**Step 2:**

Create a new virtual environment
```command line
python -m venv venv
```

**Step 3:**

Activate the virtual environment
```command line
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows use
```command line
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Step 4:**

Install dependencies
```command line
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 5:**

Ensure you have the required datasets in the data/ directory, including the mapping.csv file.

**Step 6:**

Run the code:
```command line
python3 analysis.py
```
